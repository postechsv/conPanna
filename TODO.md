## Maude backend

- Cache generated Maude modules by root state type and structural theory, so
  identical modules are not repeatedly inspected and rendered for atomic
  unification and matching queries.
- Investigate batching queries or reusing a persistent Maude process, so
  multiple queries can share one loaded module instead of launching Maude for
  every query.
